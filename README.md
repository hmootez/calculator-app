# Instructions for the assignment
* Clone this repo on your machine.
* Use your IDE of choice to complete the assignment.
* When you are done with the solution and have pushed it to the repo, [you can submit the assignment here](https://app.snapcode.review/submission_links/845d2891-2ddb-4ab9-8b65-d9c896e52427).
* Once you indicate the completion, your access to the repository will be revoked. Do make sure that you have finished the solution and pushed all the relevant code to the repo.

# About the task

We’d like you to write a basic calculator with Equal Experts branding. You can use whichever approach you prefer, with or without frameworks.

The calculator should be attractive and, while we’re not expecting all features to be implemented, any that are should match what you’d expect from a simple pocket calculator.

There’s no time limit for this task. We expect that you can give a representative piece of code in 1-2 hours.

## Tips on what we’re looking for

### 1. Test coverage

Your solution should:

- be developed 'test-first'
- have good unit tests
- cover common paths
- be self-contained and not rely on external systems when running tests. Use fakes/ mocks/ stubs as you see fit.

### 2. Simplicity

We value simplicity as an architectural virtue and a development practice. Solutions should reflect the difficulty of the assigned task, and shouldn’t be overly complex. We prefer simple, well tested solutions over clever solutions.

Please avoid:
- Unnecessary layers of abstraction
- Unnecessary patterns/ architectural features that aren’t called for

### 3. Self-explanatory code

The solution you produce must speak for itself. Multiple paragraphs explaining the solution is a sign that the code isn’t straightforward enough to understand on its own.

### 4. Dealing with ambiguity

If there’s any ambiguity, please add this in a section at the bottom of the README. You should also make a choice to resolve the ambiguity.
    
## Other Requirements

Please add a section to the botton of this README which states any requirements and commands needed to run the code. Assume the reviewer is unfamiliar with your choice of framework and/or build tools and maybe using a different IDE.
